meta_title: Jim Schubert, Sr. Lead Software Engineer
meta_description: A well-rounded hands-on senior manager level engineer who has been coding since 1988.
summary: |
  I'm a hands-on Senior Lead Software Engineer who thrives on building high-impact teams, 
  leading complex technical initiatives, and making the tough stuff feel simple. I also like coffee.

  I don't just write code â€” I architect systems that scale and create environments where teams ship confidently.
  Whether I'm mentoring engineers through their first enterprise deployment, leading organization-wide platform migrations,
  or untangling legacy systems that "nobody understands anymore," I bring curiosity, humor, and a talent for making breakthroughs feel inevitable.
  
  _My mission?_ Helping great engineering teams become exceptional, one elegant solution (and strategically-timed dad joke) at a time.
  
  Currently open to connecting with fellow engineers, discussing interesting technical challenges, or debating whether tabs or spaces are objectively correct.
